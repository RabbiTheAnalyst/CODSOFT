## üìå Project Overview
This project predicts survival on the Titanic using machine learning techniques. The dataset undergoes preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and modeling with Logistic Regression.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python üêç
- **Libraries:**
  - `pandas` - Data manipulation
  - `matplotlib` - Data visualization
  - `seaborn` - Statistical graphics
  - `scikit-learn` - Machine learning models & evaluation
- **Machine Learning Algorithm:**
  - Logistic Regression
- **Data Processing:**
  - StandardScaler (Feature Scaling)
  - Label Encoding (Categorical Data)
  - Train-Test Split
- **Model Evaluation Metrics:**
  - Accuracy Score
  - Classification Report
  - ROC-AUC Curve

## üìä Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Key visualizations included:
- **Survival Counts:** Bar charts showing survivors vs. non-survivors.
- **Gender-Based Survival:** Count plots analyzing male vs. female survival rates.
- **Pclass Impact on Survival:** Visualization of class-based survival rates.
- **SibSp & Embarked Analysis:** Insights on survival based on family size and embarkation point.
- **Age & Fare Distribution:** Kernel Density Estimations (KDE) for better data distribution understanding.
- **Correlation Heatmap:** Identifying feature relationships.

## üèÜ Model Training & Evaluation
- **Logistic Regression Model** trained with standardized features.
- Predictions assessed with:
  - **Accuracy Score** for performance measurement.
  - **Classification Report** (Precision, Recall, F1-score).
  - **ROC-AUC Curve** showcasing model effectiveness.

### üîç ROC Curve Analysis
A high **AUC score of 0.88** indicates a well-performing model with an effective balance between True Positives and False Positives.
