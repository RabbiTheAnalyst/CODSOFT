📈 Advertising Sales Prediction





📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes the relationship between advertising budgets (TV, Radio, Newspaper) and sales outcomes using a dataset (advertising.csv). The workflow includes data loading, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and a preliminary visualization of actual vs. predicted sales. While the notebook is incomplete (e.g., missing model training), it sets the stage for a regression-based sales prediction model.

Objective: Predict sales based on advertising spend
Dataset: advertising.csv (200 rows, 4 columns: TV, Radio, Newspaper, Sales)
Preprocessing:
Checked for missing values (none found)
Summary statistics for feature understanding
Potential Model: Linear Regression (assumed based on scatter plot intent)
📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The EDA phase provided insights into the dataset:

Dataset Overview: First 5 rows and structure (200 rows, 4 columns)
Missing Values: None detected
Summary Statistics: Mean, min, max, and quartiles of TV, Radio, Newspaper, and Sales
Outlier Detection: Scatter plot of actual vs. predicted sales (incomplete due to undefined y_test and predicted_y)
Future Steps: Correlation analysis and feature distribution plots (e.g., histograms, pair plots) could enhance insights
🏆 Model Training & Results
Model: Not fully implemented in the notebook (likely intended as Linear Regression)
Visualization: Scatter plot comparing actual vs. predicted sales (requires y_test and predicted_y from a trained model)
Next Steps:
Split data into training and test sets
Train a regression model (e.g., Linear Regression)
Evaluate with metrics like R², Mean Squared Error (MSE), etc. Note: The current notebook stops at EDA and visualization setup.
